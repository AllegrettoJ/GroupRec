# GroupRec
These python codes aim to recommend personalized group tours for different travelling days. We first cluster the users using 2 clustering methods: random & kmeans; and then solve the problem as an integer programming in order to recommend an ideal itinerary to each group. The package we used is pulp. The dataset used can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/limkwanhui/datacode#icaps16
